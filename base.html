					<h3>HTC Vive experience:</h3>
					<p>The games I played were <i>Hover Junkers</i>, <i>AudioShield</i>, and <i>Holopoint</i>.<br/>Overall, my experience with the Vive was rather underwhelming. <br/>The headset's display resolution and clarity wasn't as clear as I might've liked. The fps was also problematic as I felt shuttering happening constantly. Even if everything else was perfect, I feel I'd only be able to use it for maybe an hour or two at the most before getting a head/eye-ache.<br/>And everything else is far from perfect.<br/>The physical heaset didn't have the best seal either, so emersion can easily be broken by just noticing the upper and lower peripherals.<br/>Though I think the worst part is just the physical movement. It's a fantastic idea to get people off their butts to play video games, but given the limited space in which to 'play', it's hard to stay fully emmersed as there's always the awareness of not being in a magical world, but rather in a confined space.<br/>All that being said, the extra dimensions of interaction that the system offers <i>is</i> pretty neat. Though there's still a loooooong ways to go before this hits mainstream popularity. Aside from the above, the headset is also rather heavy, as such you WILL notice it each and everytime you turn your head. I suppose one could acclimate to the weight, but I'd imagine that would require a time commitment that most people would lack.<br/>Lastly, the two controllers have a considerable amount of lag and frequently lose sync. In localized environments, this is a bit annoying, but in online multiplayer senarios, it would be entirely unacceptable. If in the middle of a high-octaine team fight of some kind and a controller de-syncs for a split second that butterfly-effects its way to causing your whole team to lose the game, some serious rage will most likely take place that inevitably reflects poorly upon the overall concept.</p>
